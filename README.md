# SteamDeck-LCDtoOLED-Mod
All-in-one script to replace the boot splash, and the startup &amp; sleep videos

Use this at your own risk!

This will backup the original files in 'LCDtoOLEDModBackup' folder in the same directory where you ran runme.sh, in case it messes up.

# How to Use

(WARNING: You need to have your sudo password setup already!)

1. Download runme.sh
2. Open terminal where runme.sh is located
3. chmod +x runme.sh
4. sudo ./runme.sh

# How to revert changes
(WARNING: Make sure you have the 'LCDtoOLEDModBackup' folder that runme.sh created when you did the mod.)

1. Download restore.sh
2. Place it in the same directory where LCDtoOLEDModBackup is located. DO NOT PUT IT INSIDE LCDtoOLEDModBackup FOLDER!
3. Open terminal where restore.sh is located
4. chmod +x restore.sh
5. sudo ./restore.sh
